```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

I chose the mtcars dataset.


```{r}
mtcars
```


Here, we can see the structure of the dataset.
```{r}
str(mtcars)
```

Below, this is specifically the list of mpg's in the dataset, mtcars.
```{r}
mtcars$mpg
```

This is the mean and standard deviation of the cars's MPG.
```{r}
mean(mtcars$mpg)
sd(mtcars$mpg)
```

Here, we're going to look at the interquartile range.
```{r}
summary(mtcars$mpg)
```


Looking online, I was able to find how to plot variables using [this website](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/304423_1ad6df0bcf5545deab69b71cf9f1ed52.html) and found a trend in displacement.

```{r}
plot(mtcars$disp,mtcars$mpg, main = "MPG by Displacement" , sub = "1973-74", xlab = "Disp" , ylab = "MPG")
```
